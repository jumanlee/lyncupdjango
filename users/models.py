    #code taken from Django's main project github (guide)'s instructions: https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/contrib/auth/models.py#L128 Basically BaseUserManager does not have any method called create_superuser, so its necessary to add this, otherwise would have error when doing python manage.py createsuperuser to create super user.

    #The __str__(self) and __unicode__(self) methods are special methods in Python that allow you to define how an object should be represented as a string. These methods are called implicitly when the object is used in a context that requires a string representation, such as when it is printed or concatenated with other strings.

    #The get_full_name() method, on the other hand, is not a special method in Python. It is a method defined by Django's AbstractBaseUser model that is used to return a string representing the user's full name. However, since get_full_name() is not a special method, it will not be called implicitly when the object is used in a context that requires a string representation. Instead, you would need to call it explicitly (e.g. user.get_full_name()).

class Friendship(models.Model):

    appuser = models.OneToOneField(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="appuser")

    #[self]appfriends links to all the appuser's friends, which are also in the AppUser class. A many-to-many relationship in Django is typically represented as a join table in the database. This join table has two foreign key columns that reference the two models involved in the relationship. In this case, the join table has two foreign key columns that reference the Friendship model and the AppUser model, respectively. When you add a AppUser instance to the appfriends field of a Friendship instance, Django automatically creates a new row in the join table that links the two instances. Similarly, when you remove a User instance from the appfriends field, Django removes the corresponding row from the join table. When you access the appfriends field of a Friendship instance, Django automatically performs a database query to retrieve all of the User instances that are linked to that Friendship instance through the join table. This is many to many because one friendlist instance can be associated to many AppUser class instances. And one AppUser class instance can be associated with many friendlist instances.

    #settings.Auth User Model means it is linked to the AppUser model defined above. This is an instance of AppUser. Note that when working with ForeignKeys, they are represented as model instances. But when you serialise a model, the ForeignKey is usually serialised to the ID of the related object.
